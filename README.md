Linear modelling to determine potential effects of business investmemnt strategies on newspaper circultion rates to be determined by 3 key questions

1. Whether publications that win more Pulitzer Prizes have a smaller, or a larger, average
circulation;

3. Whether publications that win more Pulitzer Prizes see a percentage increase, or decrease, in
circulation, during the period that they win the prizes; and

5. If these relationships exist, how might the trajectory of the Boston Sun-Times's circulation
change depending on the newspapers strategic direction?

To this end, data on newspaper circulation and number of Pulitzer Prizes in a 25-year period was used to build a linear model in R Studio
